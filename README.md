This plugin exposes the Update Rate Optimisation functionality from C++ to Blueprints. With two methods of control, LOD-based or screen percent-based, you will be able to fully customise the update rate of your skinned meshes to provide powerful and effective optimisations that were previously locked to C++. 

Please check the branches for all the available engine versions.
